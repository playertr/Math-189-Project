# Math-189-Project

In our project, we will use data from the HMOG data set (http://www.cs.wm.edu/~qyang/hmog.html) to classify people's behavior on their smartphones. We will analyze data to arrive at a technique for determining which of three activities a standing phone user is doing: reading with their phone, navigating a map with their phone, or writing using the phone's keyboard.
